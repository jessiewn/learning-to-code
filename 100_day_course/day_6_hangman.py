#Step 1 

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

import random
chosen_word= random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)
guess=input('Guess a letter').lower()
#print(guess)

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.
display=[]
for n in range(0,len(chosen_word)):
    display.append('_')
print(display)

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

chosen_word_list=list(chosen_word)
print(chosen_word_list)

for i in range(len(chosen_word_list)):
    if guess == chosen_word_list[i]:
        print(i)
        print('right')
    else: 
        print('wrong')
#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
